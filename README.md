# Yawprobe

The software in this repository is made for a yawprobe. 

## Description

The project is linked to the bachelor's thesis "Design, tillverkning och testning av yaw-prob f√∂r formelbil" where a group has the task of constructing a yawprobe. A yawprobe is a sensor that can messure a fluids angle of attack in a horizontal plane, often used in motorsport. 

## Getting Started

To get started you need to uppload the code to an arduino from the arduino editor.

### Executing program

When the arduino is plugged into power it emidiatly starts to log data on a new file. To make a new log file you either have to press the arduinos reset button or cut the power.

## Help

There is alot of describing comments in the code.
